## Purpose

This document defines the shared entity type hierarchy, relationship model, evidence model, time model, and identity resolution rules used across the OCAS ecosystem.

Chronicle (Elephas) is the authoritative store for ontology instances. Skills that extract, reference, or query entities must use the types defined here.

---

## Core Node Types

### Entity

Represents a real-world actor.

Subclasses:
- **Person** — a human individual
- **AI** — a synthetic individual or agent (e.g., Indigo)

Required fields:
- `id` — unique identifier (UUID)
- `name` — canonical name
- `aliases` — list of known alternate names or handles
- `identifiers` — list of typed identifiers. See Identifier Vocabulary below.
- `type` — `Person` or `AI`
- `source_skill` — which skill created or last updated this record
- `record_time` — ISO 8601 timestamp when this record was written to Chronicle

Optional identity resolution fields:
- `possible_matches` — list of Entity ids flagged as possible duplicates
- `merge_history` — list of merge event records. Format: `[{"merged_id": "...", "merged_at": "...", "merged_by": "ocas-elephas", "reason": "..."}]`
- `identity_state` — `distinct` (default) / `possible_match` / `confirmed_same`

### Identifier Vocabulary

The `identifiers` field is a JSON array of typed identifier objects:

```json
[
  {"type": "email", "value": "user@example.com"},
  {"type": "phone", "value": "+14155551234"},
  {"type": "handle", "value": "@username"},
  {"type": "url", "value": "https://linkedin.com/in/username"},
  {"type": "domain", "value": "example.com"}
]
```

Allowed `type` values: `email`, `phone`, `handle`, `url`, `domain`, `employee_id`, `external_id`.

Skills may add skill-namespaced identifier types to cross-reference their own records. These are treated as reference pointers, not identity signals:

```json
{"type": "weave:person_id", "value": "uuid-from-weave-db"}
{"type": "scout:subject_id", "value": "req_20260305_001"}
```

### Place

Represents a physical location.

Required fields:
- `id` — unique identifier
- `name` — canonical name
- `place_type` — e.g., restaurant, office, city, venue
- `source_skill` — originating skill
- `record_time` — ISO 8601 timestamp

Optional fields:
- `coordinates` — `{"lat": 0.0, "lng": 0.0}`
- `address` — street address

### Concept

Represents an abstract idea or occurrence.

Subclasses:
- **Event** — a dated occurrence (meeting, trip, concert, purchase)
- **Action** — a discrete executed action
- **Idea** — a topic, theme, or abstract concept

Required fields:
- `id` — unique identifier
- `name` — label or title
- `description` — brief description
- `concept_type` — `Event`, `Action`, or `Idea`
- `source_skill` — originating skill
- `record_time` — ISO 8601 timestamp

### Thing

Represents a concrete or digital object.

Subclasses:
- **DigitalArtifact** — a document, file, email, or digital record
- **PhysicalArtifact** — a physical object
- **Signal** — a raw observation from a skill (see Evidence Model)
- **Candidate** — a proposed fact awaiting confirmation (see Evidence Model)

Required fields:
- `id` — unique identifier
- `name` — label or identifier
- `thing_type` — subclass name
- `metadata` — type-specific fields

---

## Relationship Model

Relationships are typed, directed edges between nodes.

Required fields:
- `source_id` — origin node
- `target_id` — destination node
- `relationship_type` — see Standard Relationship Types below
- `evidence_refs` — list of signal_ids or source references supporting this relationship
- `confidence` — `high`, `med`, or `low`
- `record_time` — ISO 8601 timestamp

Optional time fields (see Time Model).

### Confidence Derivation

When a skill produces a numeric confidence score (0.0–1.0), derive the label as follows:

- `>= 0.8` → `high`
- `>= 0.5` → `med`
- `< 0.5` → `low`

Skills may store numeric scores internally. The label form is required for Chronicle-facing fields.

### Standard Relationship Types

Between Entity and Entity:
- `knows`, `friend_of`, `colleague_of`, `family_of`, `introduced_by`, `spouse_of`, `reports_to`, `acquaintance_of`

Between Entity and Event:
- `participated_in`, `organized`, `attended`

Between Entity and Place:
- `lives_in`, `works_at`, `visited`, `associated_with`

Between Entity and Thing:
- `created`, `owns`, `uses`

Between Event and Place:
- `occurred_at`, `located_in`

Between Concept and Concept:
- `related_to`, `derived_from`, `part_of`

Skills may define additional relationship types in `snake_case` within their domains. Standard types above must be used when applicable.

---

## Evidence Model

Every fact in Chronicle traces to its source.

```
Skill Journal → Signal → supports → Candidate → becomes → Chronicle Fact
                                                         → Inference (separate, never overwrites facts)
```

### Signal

A raw observation produced by a skill. Signals are immutable after creation.

Required fields:
- `signal_id` — UUID
- `source_skill` — which skill emitted it
- `source_journal_type` — see Journal Types below
- `payload` — the observed data (structured JSON)
- `timestamp` — ISO 8601 when the signal was created
- `status` — `active` or `consumed`

### Journal Types for source_journal_type

- `Observation` — passive observation. No external side effects. Examples: Scout finding a public profile, Sift analyzing a document.
- `Action` — a skill executed an external action. Examples: Dispatch sending a message, Voyage booking a reservation.
- `Research` — structured multi-source research workflow. Examples: Scout running a full research pipeline.

### Candidate

A proposed addition to Chronicle requiring validation before becoming a confirmed fact.

Required fields:
- `candidate_id` — UUID
- `proposed_node` — full object being proposed
- `supporting_signals` — list of signal_ids
- `confidence` — `high`, `med`, or `low`
- `status` — `pending`, `confirmed`, `rejected`, or `merged`

### Promotion Rules

A candidate becomes a confirmed Chronicle fact when:
- It has at least one supporting signal
- Confidence meets the configured promotion threshold
- No contradicting evidence of higher confidence exists

Signals remain permanently attached as evidence after promotion.

### Signal Delivery

Skills emit Signals by writing a JSON file to the Elephas intake directory:

```
~/openclaw/db/ocas-elephas/intake/{signal_id}.signal.json
```

Elephas watches this directory and processes new files. After processing, files move to `intake/processed/`. Skills must not delete or modify files in either directory.

Not all skills emit Signals. Skills that maintain standalone domain databases (Weave, Triage) operate independently. They may optionally emit Signals for Chronicle promotion, but this is not required for normal operation.

---

## Time Model

Three distinct temporal fields:

- `event_time` — when the real-world event occurred
- `record_time` — when the system recorded the observation
- `valid_from` / `valid_until` — the time range during which the fact is considered true. `valid_until` is null for currently-valid facts.

All timestamps use ISO 8601 format with timezone offset (e.g., `2026-03-17T10:00:00-07:00`).

---

## Identity Resolution

### Identity States

- `distinct` — confirmed to be a separate entity (default)
- `possible_match` — may refer to the same entity; flagged for review
- `confirmed_same` — confirmed to be the same entity; eligible for merge

### Merge Rules

- Merges must be reversible. Merge history is preserved in `merge_history` on the surviving node.
- Automatic merges require confidence above the configured `auto_merge_threshold`.
- Below that threshold, matches are flagged as `possible_match` for human review.

### Resolution Precedence

1. Exact identifier match (email, phone, URL)
2. Name + location match with corroborating signals
3. Behavioral pattern match (activity overlap, relationship overlap)

Ambiguous cases must preserve separation rather than silently collapsing records.

---

## Skill Write Permissions

**Only Elephas writes confirmed facts to Chronicle.** All other skills are read-only consumers.

Skills that maintain their own domain databases (Weave, Triage) own and write exclusively to their own database files. No skill may open another skill's database as `READ_WRITE`.

Cross-skill reads are permitted. A skill may open any other skill's database as `READ_ONLY`.

Skills do not read from Chronicle as part of normal operation. Chronicle is a downstream consolidation layer, not an upstream dependency. Skills that optionally query Chronicle for enrichment must degrade gracefully when Chronicle is unavailable.

---

## Chronicle-to-Skill Reference Model

Chronicle does not copy data from skill-local databases. When a person, task, or entity exists in both a skill database and Chronicle, Chronicle stores a reference pointer using a skill-namespaced identifier:

```json
{"type": "weave:person_id", "value": "uuid-from-weave-db"}
{"type": "triage:task_id", "value": "uuid-from-triage-db"}
```

The authoritative record lives in the skill's database. Chronicle holds a pointer. Skills are responsible for the integrity of their own data.

---

## Skill Entity Extraction Ownership

Every skill that extracts, manages, or emits entities must map its outputs to the types defined in this spec. The table below documents which entity types each skill is responsible for extracting or emitting as Signals.

Skills not in this table do not extract entities and do not emit Signals to Elephas.

| Skill | Entity Types | Place Types | Concept Types | Thing Types | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ocas-scout | Person, AI | — | — | DigitalArtifact | Extracts people and their public profiles |
| ocas-sift | Person, AI | Place | Event, Idea | DigitalArtifact | General entity extraction from research |
| ocas-look | Person | Place | Event, Action | DigitalArtifact | Entities extracted from images |
| ocas-thread | — | — | Idea | — | Research topic threads (interests, sources) |
| ocas-corvus | — | — | Idea | Signal | Patterns and anomalies; behavioral signals |
| ocas-weave | Person | — | — | — | Social graph; Person nodes only |
| ocas-taste | — | Place | Action | DigitalArtifact | Venues, consumed items, behavioral actions |
| ocas-voyage | — | Place | Event, Action | — | Venues, trip events, booking actions |
| ocas-rally | — | — | Event | Thing | Market events; securities as Things |
| ocas-sands | — | Place | Event | — | Event locations resolved via Google Places API; calendar events created/modified |
| ocas-dispatch | Person | — | Action | DigitalArtifact | Contacts, sent/received messages |
| ocas-vesper | — | — | — | — | Aggregates only; does not extract entities |
| ocas-custodian | — | — | — | — | System health only; no entity extraction |
| ocas-spot | — | Place | Event | — | Venues booked + confirmed appointments |
| ocas-haiku | — | — | — | — | No entity extraction; cooperative Chronicle read only |
| ocas-bower | — | — | — | DigitalArtifact | Drive files/folders; structural pattern signals (optional) |
| ocas-triage | — | — | — | — | No entity extraction; queue and scheduling only |
| ocas-relay | — | — | — | DigitalArtifact | Device attachments only; no Elephas emission |
| ocas-elephas | — | — | — | — | Chronicle writer only; no entity extraction from user data |
| ocas-mentor | — | — | — | — | Orchestration engine; no entity extraction |
| ocas-praxis | — | — | — | — | Behavioral refinement; no entity extraction |
| ocas-forge | — | — | — | — | Skill architect; no entity extraction |
| ocas-fellow | — | — | — | — | Experimentation engine; no entity extraction |

**Rules:**
- A skill's extracted entity types must be present in its emitted Signals' `payload.type` field.
- Skills that query Chronicle or Weave for entity context (read-only consumers) are not listed here — this table covers extraction and emission only.
- Skills not listed above (Elephas, Praxis, Mentor, Forge, Fellow) do not extract entities from user data. Elephas is the Chronicle writer; others operate on skill-internal data.

| ocas-sift | Yes | For entities and relationships extracted with confidence ≥ med |
| ocas-look | Yes | For entities identified in processed images |
| ocas-thread | Yes | For Chronicle candidates only (sessions ≥ 3, long_clicks ≥ 3) |
| ocas-corvus | Optional | For behavioral signals routed to Praxis; does not emit entity signals |
| ocas-weave | Optional | May emit Person signals for Chronicle promotion |
| ocas-taste | No | Taste maintains its own preference model; does not emit to Chronicle |
| ocas-voyage | No | Voyage manages trip state; does not emit entity signals to Chronicle |
| ocas-rally | No | Rally maintains its own portfolio data; does not emit to Chronicle |
| ocas-sands | No | Sands manages calendar state; Place and Event data retained in decisions.jsonl only; does not emit to Chronicle |

| ocas-bower | Optional | May emit DigitalArtifact signals for structural Drive discoveries |
| ocas-triage | No | Does not emit entity signals to Chronicle |
| ocas-relay | No | Device attachments stored locally; downstream skills handle Chronicle ingestion |
| ocas-custodian | No | System health only; no entity signals |
| ocas-elephas | N/A | Reads Signals and writes Chronicle facts; not an emitter |
| ocas-mentor | No | Orchestration engine; no entity signals |
| ocas-praxis | No | Behavioral refinement; no entity signals |
| ocas-forge | No | Skill architect; no entity signals |
| ocas-fellow | No | Experimentation engine; no entity signals |

## Expected Scale

Nodes: 100k–500k
Edges: 5M–20M
Target hardware: Mac Studio, 512GB–1TB RAM, embedded LadybugDB.

---

## Usage by Skills

Skills that extract entities (Sift, Scout, Look, Corvus, Thread, Weave, Taste, Voyage, Spot, Sands) must map their extracted data to the types defined here. See the Skill Entity Extraction Ownership table above for the full mapping.

Skills that query entities (Weave, Vesper, Dispatch, Taste, Voyage, Haiku) expect the types defined here when reading from Chronicle or Weave's social graph.

Skills that emit Signals to Elephas must set `payload.type` to the ontology type of the primary entity in the signal (e.g., `Person`, `Place`, `Idea`).

Elephas is the only skill that writes confirmed facts to Chronicle.
